# activity-stream

[![Task Status](https://github.taskcluster.net/v1/repository/mozilla/activity-stream/master/badge.svg)](https://github.taskcluster.net/v1/repository/mozilla/activity-stream/master/latest)

This system add-on replaces the new tab page in Firefox with a new design and
functionality as part of the Activity Stream project.

The files in this directory, including vendor dependencies, are imported from the
system-addon directory in https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream.

Read [docs/v2-system-addon](https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream/tree/master/docs/v2-system-addon/1.GETTING_STARTED.md) for more detail.

## Where should I file bugs?

We regularly check the ActivityStream:NewTab component on Bugzilla.
