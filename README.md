# Firefox Home (New Tab) [Deprecated Version]

This repository is no longer updated or used. We're keeping it around for
those few occasions when it's useful for doing code & bugfix archaeology by
looking at issues and PRs.  

Please do not file new issues or PRs; they will not be triaged.  Issues are now
tracked on Bugzilla, in `Firefox: New Tab Page` and `Firefox: Messaging
System`.
