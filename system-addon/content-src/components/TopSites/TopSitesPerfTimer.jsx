/**
 * A proxy class that uses double requestAnimationFrame from
 * componentDidMount to dispatch a SAVE_SESSION_PERF_DATA to the main procsess
 * after the paint.
 *
 * This uses two callbacks because, after one callback, this part of the tree
 * may have rendered but not yet reflowed.  This strategy is modeled after
 * https://stackoverflow.com/a/34999925 but uses a double rFA because
 * we want to get to the closest reliable paint for measuring, and
 * setTimeout is often throttled or queued by browsers in ways that could
 * make it lag too long.
 *
 * XXX Should be made more generic by using this.props.children, or potentially
 * even split out into a higher-order component to wrap whatever.
