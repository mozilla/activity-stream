# Activity Stream (System add-on)

## Where to ask questions

- Most of the core dev team can be found on the `#activity-stream` mozilla irc channel.
  You can also direct message the core team (`dmose`, `emtwo`, `jkerim`, `k88hudson`, `Mardak`, `nanj`, `r1cky`, `ursula`)
  or our manager (`tspurway`)
- Our Mozilla slack channel is #activitystream
- File issues/questions on Github: https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream/issues. We typically triage new issues every Monday.

## Testing in Firefox Nightly

If you just want to see the current version of Activity Stream in Firefox, you can
install [Firefox Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#nightly)
go to `about:config`, and set the `browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.enabled` pref
to `true`.

## Prerequisites for development

### Operating system

The Activity Stream development environment is designed to work on Mac and Linux.
If you need to develop on Windows, you might want to reach out on IRC (#activity-stream)
if you run into any problems.

### Software

- Node.js 6.9.1+ (On Mac, the best way to install Node.js is to use the [install link on the Node.js homepage](https://nodejs.org/en/))
- npm (packaged with Node.js)

### activity-stream

You will need to to clone Activity Stream to a local directory from the `master`
branch of our Github repository: https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream

```
git clone https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream.git
```

### Mozilla Central
You will need a local copy of Mozilla Central in a directory named `mozilla-central`.
That directory should be a sibling of your local `activity-stream` directory (like so):

```
/
  mozilla-central/
  activity-stream/
```

Check out [these docs on artifact builds](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Artifact_builds)
for instructions about how to download and configure Mozilla Central if you have
never done so before.

## Source code and PRs

The latest copy of the source code for Activity Stream can be found in the `system-addon/`
subdirectory of `activity-stream`.

The current version of Activity Stream that is shipped with Firefox nightly can
be found in `mozilla-central/browser/extensions/activity-stream`. Keep in mind that
some of these files are generated, so if you intend on editing any files, you should
do so in the Github version.

PRs should be sent against the master branch of https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream,
NOT against mozilla central.

## Building

1. Install required dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. To build Activity Stream, run `npm run buildmc` from the root of the
`activity-stream` directory. This will build the js and css files and copy them
into the `browser/extensions/activity-stream` directory inside Mozilla Central.
3. Build and run Firefox from the `mozilla-central` directory by running `./mach build && ./mach run`.

## Continuous development

Running `npm run startmc` will start a process that watches files in `activity-stream`
and continuously builds/copies changes to `mozilla-central`. You will
still need to rebuild Firefox (`./mach build`) if you change `.jsm` files.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run testmc` to run the unit tests with karma/mocha. The source code for these
tests can be found in `system-addon/test/unit/`.

Our unit tests expect 100% code coverage, so if you see any missing coverage,
you can inspect the coverage report by running `npm run testmc && npm run debugcoverage`.
