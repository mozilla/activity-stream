# Activity Stream Pings

The Activity Stream system add-on sends various types of pings to the backend (HTTPS POST) [Onyx server](https://github.com/mozilla/onyx) :
- a `session` ping that describes the ending of an Activity Stream session (lose focus event on Activity Stream), and
- an `event` ping that records specific data about individual user interactions while interacting with Activity Stream
- a `performance` ping that records specific performance related events
- an `undesired` ping that records data about bad app states and missing data

Schema definitions/validations that can be used for tests can be found in `system-addon/test/schemas/pings.js`.
